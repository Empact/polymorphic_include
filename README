PolymorphicInclude
==================

Polymorphic associations in Ruby on Rails seem like a good idea until it
comes time to join the tables back together. Since it is impossible to eager
load the data with a :include parameter, we're doing the next best thing.
We have Content objects that have two polymorphic associations (content type
and source). When trying to show search results you actually need all of the
data which means it is two additional queries per tuple. Instead, we reduced
it to k queries per page where k is the number of different types of objects.
Enough chatting, here's the code for overriding the find method. It
assumes you are using the default "_type" suffix. With this code you can just
use a :include directive in your finds and it will return your associations
instead of throwing an exception.
